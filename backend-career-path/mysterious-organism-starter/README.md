## Context

Guided by Codecademy's project directives, this project places you as part of a research team that has found a new mysterious organism named P. aequor. Your job is to create objects that simulate the DNA of P. aequor for your research team to study. The goal of this project is to reinforce functional programming principles in `JavaScript`.

## Project Overview

In this project, I created functions and methods to modify and investigate random strings representing DNA. The developed methods assess the likelihood of specimen survival, determine the percentage of DNA commonality between specimens, induce random mutations, and identify complementary DNA strands.

## How to Begin

- Fork and clone the repository to your local machine and open the directory.  
- Run `node main.js`, results will be displayed in the terminal.
  - The results will be displayed in the terminal, presenting a random set of specimens along with the percentage of common DNA strands. The process concludes by listing specimens with the highest common DNA strands.
