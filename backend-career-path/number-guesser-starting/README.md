## Context

This project, guided by Codecademy's directives, served as a practical exercise to solidify functional programming concepts in JavaScript. The provided startup code included HTML, CSS, and essential DOM manipulating functions.

## Project Overview

The focus of this project was the development of a browser-based number-guessing game. I implemented crucial JavaScript functions to drive the game's logic. The game generates a random number between 0 and 9, and the player must guess that number. Winning a round depends on how close the player's guess is to the computer's guess, with the overall score updating based on wins and losses.

## How to Begin

- To start, fork and clone the repository to your local machine.
- cd into the directory
- Run `open index.html` to open the game in the browser
- Play the game and have fun!
