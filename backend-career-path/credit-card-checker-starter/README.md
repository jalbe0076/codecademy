## Context

Guided by Codecademy's project directives, this project places you in the role of a clerk responsible for optimizing the credit card validation process. The goal was to reinforce functional programming principles in `JavaScript`.

## Project Overview

In this project, I created functions to automate the validation of credit card numbers using the Luhn algorithm. The goal was to enhance efficiency by identifying invalid cards and categorizing potential issuers based on unique identifiers. This automated approach replaces the manual, time-consuming checks performed by other clerks, introducing a more streamlined and reliable verification process.

## How to Begin

- Fork and clone the repository to your local machine and open the directory.  
- Run `node main.js` to confirm if provided credit cards are valid, results will be displayed in the terminal.
  - The results will log a mix of different function outputs along with some known valid and invalid fake credit card numbers.
