## Context

Guided by Codecademy's project directives, this project allows users to play an interactive terminal game. The purpose was to reinforce object-oriented programming principles and `node`.

## Project Overview

In this project, you’ll be building an interactive terminal game. The scenario is that the player has lost their hat in a field full of holes, and they must navigate back to it without falling down one of the holes or stepping outside of the field.

A field consists of a grid containing “holes” (`O`) and one “hat” (`^`). The character (`░`) indicates a neutral field where the player can pass. The player will begin in the upper-left of the field, and the player’s path is represented by `*`.

Example field:
```
  *░O
  ░O░
  ░^░
```
## How to Begin

- Fork and clone the repository to your local machine and open the directory.  
- Run `npm install` to install the project dependencies.
- Run `node main.js` to start the game in the terminal, and follow game instructions. 
- Have fun!
